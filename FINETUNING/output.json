          "question": "What are some circumstances under which the TPMS low tyre pressure warning light may come on despite correct tyre pressure?",
          "answer": "The low tyre pressure warning light may come on under various conditions including replacing a flat tyre with the spare tyre, including a spare tyre during a tyre rotation, damaging the TPMS sensor during a tyre replacement, using electric devices or metallic films that interfere with radio waves, using non-genuine Maruti Suzuki wheels or tyres, and when the tyre pressure is too high."

        {
          "question": "Why is it recommended to use a flat tyre repair kit instead of a spare tyre if the tyre pressure is too high?",
          "answer": "Using a flat tyre repair kit instead of a spare tyre when the tyre pressure is too high is recommended because the flat tyre repair kit has an integrated TPMS sensor, whereas the spare tyre typically does not. This ensures that the TPMS can continue to monitor tyre pressure even if you're dealing with a flat tyre situation."

        {
          "question": "What precautions should be taken to avoid damaging the TPMS sensors during tyre changes or repairs?",
          "answer": "To prevent damage to the TPMS sensors, it's recommended that you have tyres repaired or replaced at a Maruti Suzuki authorized workshop. Additionally, never use liquid sealants for a flat tyre unless your vehicle is equipped with a flat tyre repair kit, as this can damage the TPMS sensor. Also, ensure that no metallic films that might interfere with radio waves are attached to the windows, especially around the wheels or wheel housings, and that snow tyres or chains are genuine and compatible with the TPMS sensors."

It is especially important to\nobserve the following precautions\nduring the first 960 km of vehicle\noperation.\n• After starting, do not race the\nengine. Warm it up gradually.\n• Avoid prolonged vehicle operation\nat a constant speed. Moving parts\nwill break in better if you vary your\nspeed.\n• Start off from a stop slowly. Avoid\nfull throttle starts.\n• Avoid \nhard \nbraking, \nespecially\nduring the first 320 km of driving.\n• Do not drive slowly with the trans-\nmission in a high gear.\n• Drive the vehicle at moderate\nengine speeds.\n• Do not tow a trailer during the first\n960 km of vehicle operation.\nNOTICE\nTo minimize the possibility of cata-\nlytic converter or other vehicle dam-\nage:\n• Maintain the engine in the proper\noperating condition.\n• In the event of an engine malfunc-\ntion, particularly one involving\nengine misfire or other apparent\nloss of performance, have the vehi-\ncle serviced promptly.\n• Do not turn off the engine or inter-\nrupt the ignition when the transmis-\nsion is in gear and the vehicle is in\nmotion.\n• Do not try to start the engine by\npushing or towing the vehicle, or\ncoasting down a hill.\n• Do not idle the engine with any\nspark plug wires disconnected or\nremoved, such as during diagnos-\ntic testing.\n• Do not idle the vehicle for pro-\nlonged periods if idling seems\nrough or there are other malfunc-\ntions.\n• Do not allow the fuel tank to get\nnear the empty level.",

Avoid\nabrupt acceleration and deceleration.\nGradual acceleration and deceleration\nwill make more effective use of the elec-\ntric motor (traction motor) without having\nto use gasoline engine power.\n• Avoid repeated acceleration. Repeated\nacceleration consumes hybrid battery\n(traction battery) power, resulting in poor\nfuel consumption. Battery power can be\nrestored by driving with the accelerator\npedal slightly released.\nWarming up before driving\nSince the gasoline engine starts up and\ncuts out automatically when cold, warming\nup the engine is unnecessary. Moreover,\nfrequently driving short distances will\ncause the engine to repeatedly warm up,\nwhich can lead to excess fuel consump-\ntion.\nWARNING\nBe careful where you park and drive;\nthe catalytic converter and other\nexhaust components can get very\nhot. As with any vehicle, do not park\nor operate this vehicle in areas where\ncombustible materials such as dry\ngrass or leaves can come in contact\nwith a hot exhaust system.",

Please\nread and follow these instructions carefully.\nImportant Information about Corro-\nsion\nCommon causes of corrosion\n1) Accumulation of road salt, dirt, moisture\nor chemicals in hard-to-reach areas of\nthe vehicle underbody or frame.\n2) Chipping, scratches and any damage to\ntreated or painted metal surfaces\nresulting from minor accidents or abra-\nsion by stones and gravel.\n3) Any or all of the below mentioned\npoints:\n• Continuous exposure to sunlight.\n• Hard water & sea water coming in con-\ntact with vehicle.\n• Foot rubbing (skirting).\nEnvironmental conditions which accel-\nerate corrosion\n1) Road salt, dust control chemicals, sea\nbreeze or industrial pollution will all\naccelerate the corrosion of metal.\n2) High humidity will increase the rate of\ncorrosion particularly when the tem-\nperature range is just above the freez-\ning point.\n3) Moisture in certain areas of a vehicle\nfor an extended period of time may pro-\nmote corrosion even when other body\nsections are completely dry.\n4) High temperatures will cause an accel-\nerated rate of corrosion to parts of the\nvehicle which are not well-ventilated to\npermit quick drying.\nThis information illustrates the necessity of\nkeeping your vehicle (particularly the\nunderbody) as clean and dry as possible. It\nis equally important to repair any damage\nto the paint or protective coatings as soon\nas possible.\nHow to Help Prevent Corrosion\nWash your vehicle frequently\nThe best way to preserve the finish on your\nvehicle and to help avoid corrosion is to\nkeep it clean with frequent washing.\nWash your vehicle at least once during the\nwinter and once immediately after the win-\nter. Keep your vehicle, particularly the\nunderside, as clean and dry as possible.\nIf you frequently drive on salted roads,\nyour vehicle should be washed at least\nonce a month during the winter. If you live\nnear the ocean, your vehicle should be\nwashed at least once a month throughout\nthe year.\nFor washing instructions, refer to “Cleaning\nExterior” section.\nRemove foreign material deposits\nForeign materials such as salts, chemicals,\nroad oil or tar, tree sap, bird droppings and\nindustrial fall-out may damage the finish of\nyour vehicle if it is left on painted surfaces.\nRemove these types of deposits as quickly\nas possible. If these deposits are difficult to\nwash off, an additional cleaner may be\nrequired. Check that any cleaner you use\nis not harmful to painted surfaces and is\nspecifically intended for your purposes.\nFollow the manufacturer’s directions when\nusing these special cleaners.\nRepair finish damage\nCarefully examine your vehicle for damage\nto the painted surfaces. Should you find\nany chips or scratches in the paint, touch\nthem up immediately to prevent corrosion\nfrom starting. If the chips or scratches have\ngone through to the bare metal, have a\nqualified body shop make the repair.",

Occasionally, check under these\nmats to ensure that this area is clean and\ndry. More frequent checks are necessary if\nthe vehicle is used for off-road driving or in\nwet weather.\nCertain cargos such as chemicals, fertiliz-\ners, cleaners, salts, etc. are extremely cor-\nrosive by nature. These products should\nbe transported in sealed containers. If they\nare spilled or leaked, clean and dry the\narea immediately.\nPark your vehicle in a dry, well-venti-\nlated area\nPark your vehicle to save it from continu-\nous exposure to direct sunlight. Do not\npark your vehicle in a damp, poorly-venti-\nlated area. If you often wash your vehicle\nin the garage and place it there in wet con-\ndition, your garage may be damp. The high\nhumidity in the garage may cause or accel-\nerate corrosion. A wet vehicle may corrode\neven in a heated garage if the ventilation is\npoor.\nCleaning Exterior\nFor Keeping the Paintwork Beauti-\nful\nTo keep your vehicle’s beautiful appear-\nance for a long term, daily care is import-\nant.\n• For parking and storing the vehicle, we\nrecommend garages with good ventila-\ntion and locations with roofs.\n• The following situations may cause rust-\ning and discoloration of the paint. Wash\nyour vehicle promptly.\n– When driving in coastal areas or on\nroads sprayed with antifreeze agent\n(Wash the underside of the vehicle\nand around the wheel wells especially)\n– When bird droppings, dead insects,\nsap, iron dust, soot or smoke residue,\ncoal tar, etc., adhere to the paint or\nwhen the vehicle gets wet with acid\nrain\n– When the vehicle is dirty with dust or\nmud\n• Give the vehicle a wax about once a\nmonth or whenever the water-repelling\nability of the painted surfaces has\ndeclined. Follow all instructions on the\npackage of the wax (sold separately).\nNOTE:\nDo not use wax on plastic parts that are\nnot coated. Waxing these surfaces could\nresult in a whitened or uneven appear-\nance.\n80J302\n• Chips from flying rocks, scratches, etc.\ncan cause rust. Repair these areas as\nsoon as possible.\nWARNING\nDo not apply additional undercoating\nor rust preventive coating on or\naround exhaust system components\nsuch as the catalytic converter and\nthe exhaust pipes. It may catch a fire\nif \nthe \nundercoating \nsubstance\nbecomes overheated.\nNOTICE\n• When \nrepairing \nscratches \non\npainted surfaces, consult a Maruti\nSuzuki authorized workshop. Using\nan inappropriate material for repair\ncould cause damage to the paint.\n• It is important that your vehicle be\nkept clean and free from dirt. Fail-\nure to keep your vehicle clean may\nresult in fading of the paint or cor-\nrosion to various parts of the vehi-\ncle body.",
